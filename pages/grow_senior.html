                                <li>Good discovery is about asking a series of questions, to get your buyer to give you
                                    real life examples of how they will use your product, and to solve some type of gap
                                    they have</li>
                                <li>Being able to ask the right questions, clarify answers, and demonstrate that you
                                    understand another person's needs is one of the most important skill sets you can
                                    have in sales</li>
                                <li>Sales discovery is a chance for both you and your decision maker to understand each
                                    other beyond a two-person exchange. </li>
                                <li>It’s not a game of 20 +questions, but rather a two-way discussion that occurs at the
                                    end of the qualifying phase and before the product demo</li>
                                <li>When conducting discovery, it is important to realize that each party is speaking
                                    from and listening through a filter of their own experiences, knowledge, and
                                    beliefs. </li>
                                <li>The goal is to speak their language, while building enough value to set the demo

                                <li>Slow, unwavering cadence of speech - place emphasis only on key words</li>
                                <li>Stay silent for several moments and really LISTEN</li>
                                <li>Use ‘why’ questions to understand the intent behind their priorities</li>
                                <li>Avoid leading with questions that do the opposite of building rapport even if you
                                    want the answer right away</li>
                                <li>Gong AI Data shows that a high number of speaker switches per min (3.2/min) help the

                            Nick from 30 Minutes to Presidents Club podcast provides some excellent tips for discovery
                            <ul>
                                <li>"Most folks don't usually wake up on a Wednesday morning and decide they gotta check
                                    out a demo of our lead routing software. Could you tell me about the moment in time
                                    when you realized that this was actually a problem?"</li>
                                <li>Use “typically questions” to raise problems instead of plain open-ended questions
                                    • “Typically when you’re doing X, that means A, B, or C can be challenging”</li>
                                <li>Use “bucket questions” to get your prospect to agree to 1 of 2 problems. </li>
                                <li>“Other CROs usually are focused on ramping reps more quickly, or making existing
                                    reps more successful, what’s your priority?”</li>
                                <li>Uncomfortable question? Call it out with a humbling disclaimer to ask probing
                                    questions without offending: </li>
                                <li>“I know this one might be out of bounds, but…”</li>
                                <li>Soften probing questions by using “scale questions” </li>
                                <li>“Is this a 1 meaning it’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen, or a 10 meaning you
                                    wanted it yesterday?”</li>
                                <li>Get your prospects visualizing next steps to accelerate the deal. </li>
                                <li>Use phrases like “Let’s say you love what you see...what happens next?”</li>
                                <li>If you sense you’re not meeting the mark, call it out.</li>
                                <li>“Hey, it sounds like we do X well, but we’re missing Y and Z. Are those dealbreakers
                                    for you?” </li>
                                <li>Empathize - “We hear stuff like this frequently, it’s amazing how…”</li>
                                <li>Story - “I remember we were talking to X the other day and they said…”</li>
                                <li>Recap - "What I am hearing from you is...."</li>

                                Doing a demo without an in-depth discovery is risky but good reps know that discovery is
                                a marathon and good demos include a lot of curious questions to get you prospect
                                talking.

                                <li>Nick at 30 Minutes to President’s Club podcast suggests accepting that ask and to
                                    not be the demo gate keeper. </li>
                                <li>However, it is critical to ask for something back by saying “sounds like you have
                                    something specific in mind - can you tell me what you are hoping to see?” </li>
                                <li>Now you have the insights to do more discovery to determine what is most important.

                                <li>his reasonable ask forces them to think and articulate their needs and pain points

                                If you are not doing an in-depth discovery while on the demo you miss out on opportunity
                                to influence your buyer.
                                Kyle Asay from Sales Introvert talks about the difference between a good discovery and a
                                bad one in his Solutions and Presentations Framework.
                                “Deep discovery requires context. Initial discovery helps you get the context you need
                                from your buyer to begin a solution presentation. Starting solution presentation gives
                                your buyer the context to move with you into the deeper discovery you’ll need to win
                                complex deals” Kyle Asay provides this great example in his frameworks on
                                salesintorverts.com

                                expansion by cross-selling all of your additional products.[3] You’re hosting team
                                meetings and pipeline reviews, but you’re not seeing many additional

                                is incredibly difficult, and humans will forget 80% of what they learn within 48
                                hours. And you can’t be on every call with your reps, listen to every recording, nor
                                can you read every email to know if your reps are cross-selling effectively in every
                                opportunity.[4] But if you can do this effectively, there is a potential for $10M

                                <li>He also encourages using “typically” instead of using love/I language. </li>

                                <li>Instead, you can say “these demos typically go 1 of two ways - you either see the
                                    value and warrants next steps, or you think it’s the worst solution ever.”</li>
                                <li>By using the word “typically” (Or "usually" / "most of the time") communicates that
                                    you know how other people have bought and are following a proven roadmap for success
                                    (not an arbitrary process) This is a great way to build trust in demos and is a pro

                                Finish the meeting by letting them know what is required on their end for the solution
                                to work the way it should and be a success. Use the last slide of your presentation to
                                set clear goals and expectations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Expectations their necessary commitment and skill and of course budget required

                                <li>In some cases, an additional meeting may happen- but it is important to end the
                                    meeting with what you will need to do to prepare next time</li>
                                <li>The ideal scenario is you can come to a mutual understanding based on trust, value
                                    and empathy and you can close the deal.</li>

                            <ul>Use: Slides from your Discovery
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Kyle Asay from Sales Introverts says if there are slides that you want to share
                                        with your customer further, to have slides that are geared towards that concept.
                                        This provides a back-and-forth cadence to talk about these key aspects while
                                        going into a deeper discovery. </li>
                                    <li>Kyle mentions in his Solutions and Presentation Frameworks that you should have
                                        a discovery understanding slide. This will include the “buyer’s current state,
                                        negative consequences, desired after state, and expected positive outcomes. It’s
                                        a great slide to 1) dig deeper with your primary contact(s) and 2) validate and
                                        expand with new contacts added to the conversation.”</li>

                                    <li>While not feature dumping, using slide images to go over the major solutions of
                                        your tool but Kyle Asay says it is critical to call out exactly what solutions

                                    <li>While those may be few and far between Kyle suggests showing an example of how
                                        you solved your buyer’s problem and another example of your solution working for
                                        a similar company. </li>
                                    <li>Kyle says these two examples will build enough trust. The goal is to haze an
                                        engaging, ongoing conversation with about equal talk time for both seller and
                                        buyer.</li>

                                Do Not Use: Company History - Leave out your founder story, awards. No one cares<br>
                                Do Not Use: Customer Logo Slides - It isn’t about the logos your brand has worked with,

                            When doing a demonstration, especially one that is going to be recorded, consider using
                            multiple browser profiles or incognito mode.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create multiple buyer personas via browser profiles - helps you show the point of
                                    view
                                    with additional admin controls</li>
                                <li>Will help you demo in the context of multiple logged on users - no need to load
                                    multiple
                                    browsers, eliminating the need to use private mode to accomplish this</li>
                                <li>In some cases, it may be helpful to prerecord your demo vs try to wing it live</li>
                            </ul>

                            <big>Screen Sharing & Load Times</big>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Full Screen - Use F11 to enter full screen, giving you more space for demos and hide
                                    open
                                    pages and get you into full screen</li>
                                <li>Avoid Page load time – load webpages for your demo ahead of time, and use CTRL + Tab
                                    to
                                    quickly switch between active tabs, avoiding load times.</li>
                                <li>Webpage load times or file load time can really lower the energy of your demo</li>

                                <li>You can always switch between windows using ALT + tab but there is a cleaner way to

                                <li>F11 will open full screen - You can use the CTRL + Tab key to switch between active

                                A/B testing in sequences doesn’t have to be completed. Start by tweaking the CTA in your
                                cold emails.
                                Here are three formulas you can try: <br><br>

                                <big>This or that</big>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Give your prospect a way out that assumes the positive.</li>
                                <li>“Are you running across that right now? Or are you totally good to go in this area?”
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>“Would it be a bad idea to share more?”</li>
                                <li>“Would it hurt to share more?”</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><big>Multiple choice</big>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Give the prospect options and tell them how to respond if they’re interested.</li>
                                <li>“Can you reply with “1” or “2” and I’ll send over a quick video showing how your
                                    competitors are handling those challenges?”</li>

                                <li>Gong’s CTA data is pretty revealing: asking for interest vs. asking for time
                                    performs 2x better.</li>
                                <li>Don’t copy/paste the CTAs above for your cold emails. Use them for ideas.</li>
                                <li>Try keeping everything the same in your cold emails, but A/B test the CTAs to boost
                                    your positive reply rates.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <br><br>It could come across as laziness at times.

                            <br><br>This "Grouped" Sequence feature allows you to choose prospects to target and place
                            them ALL in the same sequence within the TO and CC fields.

                            pulled out of the sequence together.

                            <br><br>Simply click "Show Advanced" after you choose the appropriate sequence.

                            <br><br>This also helps to show that you care about the collective mind.

                                This can be as simple as a spreadsheet, or (some of this can be) as involved as creating
                                an actual dashboard/leaderboard type view on Salesforce, or whatever you're using.

<p><big>Pricing</big>
<p>When talking about closing, pricing will come up. Especially in SaaS pricing is super important- learn more about pricing mistakes from Kyles paid frameworks. Kyle Asway in his End of Deal Frameworks talks about how the SaaS pricing model is constantly changing and you don’t get credit for proactive discounting. Kyle suggests refusing to negotiate price until the scope is finalized.


<p><big>End of Deal: Getting to the Close</big>
<ul><li>When building relationships with prospects these signs could be the client trying to end the conversation, or they are planting seeds of interest.</li>
<li>When closing deals and getting contracts, it is important to not get too eager, and use your emotional intelligence.</li></ul>

<p><big>End of Deal: Genuine Interest </big>
	<ul><li>They are more positive and give quicker replies - duh</li>
	<li>When the sales cycle is at a normal pace, and suddenly they speed-up the process. </li>
	<li>Your prospect starts asking specific questions around the tool & service pricing.</li>
	<li>Prospects start inquiring about your case studies, other paying clients and success stories in their industry.</li>
	<li>They show any interest in moving the conversation forward, or who, what, when where and why this tool will be used.</li>
	<li>Keep building HYPE & creating urgency </li></ul>

                                    This is a closing technique that assumes the sale. Confidence is key here!
Instead of asking if they want to buy, instead asking them how many seats they want. This closing method requires someone with a nurturing sales approach as to not ruin the rapport.
This close should only be used after building value as it does give the prospect enough time to talk about pains and objections, they would have.

<P>Examples:
	<ul><li>When can we get started on implantation of the tool?</li> 
	<li>Our customer success team will be reaching out today to start x if this works?</li>
	<li>Do you want to go with x tier or y tier? Who is best to send financial paperwork too?</li>
	<li>What is the name and contact of your accounting teams for billing?</li></ul>

                                        Salespeople by nature are usually pretty good storytellers! This may be your chance to shine depending on how you decide to utilize this closing technique.<br><br>
The best part of this closing technique is you have uncovered enough needs, value or examples and do not need to give discounts or promotional offering.<br><br>
Perfect this pitch using all the information you have learned in discovery about workflows, org charts and how your prospect measures success! A valued based, organic summary pitch may be enough close the deal- but it is important to note that some sellers have to attempt to close 5+ times before they get the contract signed.<br><br>
Some gifted sellers with a track record of success with similar use cases and personas will add an additional case study to really loop their success to the destined success your prospect will have if they buy.<br><br>
This closing technique is usually coupled with the assumptive close- or if done right will give you enough insights to do exactly what you need to do to win their business.<br><Br>
Some of the best use visuals in their presentation.

                                            The Now or Never Close is a classic way of getting the prospect to buy now, this technique works because it creates as sense of urgency.<br><br>
If you have by promising added features now. It works well when the prospect is having a hard time moving to yes- they are curious but not sold just yet.
	<ul><li>"We’ve got a 0% discount just for customers who sign up before end of quarter”</li>
	<li>“If you commit to buy before Friday, I can fast track you to the front of the implementation queue.”</li></ul>
<p>SaaS sales is all about retaining clients, and upselling/cross selling down the line. However, a good way to close the deal immediately can be to utilize the now or never method but offer to add one of the many added features of the tool.<br><br>

    For example, the ability for a more seamless integration, ability to add more contacts, or send more emails.
This same Method can be used by offering to reduce the prospect to a lower cost plan that can be expanded on later. This tactic only works if value is there, but they have objections such as budget.

                                        <div class="panel">

                                                    Referrals that stick and pay are the real deal. Deals that come through referrals have a higher conversion rate, higher retention rate and lower churn rate. DUH!<br><br>
Most salespeople ask for a referral after the close, but some salespeople use this as a method to get to the close.
Some resources suggest you bring this closing technique up when you feel like your prospect has zoned out, and by straight up asking for someone they know who is a fit for the services may bring back interest. This is done by showing curiosity around their referrals needs and why your prospect seems like a fit.<br><br>
Engaging in a light discovery may bring more light to the current conversation by talking more about this potential prospect needs and goals. Relate them back to your DM to close by connecting those same dots!

                                            <div class="panel">
                                                    <p>
                                                        Providing multiple options for your buyer is the best way to avoid a black and white – yes or no response. This closing technique is best to use when you have a prospect who is unsure how often they will use the product or are having budget objections.<br><br> 
Instead of going for the close and offering a single service package you ask them to choose from 1-3 options. A common approach for this is service lengths. Do not overwhelm them with too many options to chose from. For example, a 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year subscription. 
<br><Br>
If you straight up ask them if they want a subscription, you may get the no you are trying to avoid. Testing the waters and offering a specific length may give you more insights (or a sale!) on what will satisfy their current needs.

<p>Example:
Now that I know all of your needs and requirements, I think these two options works best. Would you like to go with x length or y length.

                                                    </p>
                                                </div>

                                                <button class="accordion">Needs and Sharp Close Technique</button>
                                                <div class="panel">
                                                        <p>
                                                            This technique happens during the discovery process when a client will say what they like and don’t like about a product, services, or features. All feedback is good feedback, and when you get this feedback and see an opportunity to get the client what they need and close the deal- DO IT!<br><br>
In the world of SaaS and services there is a lot that can be customized to the client, and a lot of information to work with if you get the client talking about their needs.<br><br>
The sharp angel close comes up in software/SaaS because of all the details that need to align in order for a successful implantation to happen, especially in more complex deals. This includes installations and service/ software updates and other aspects of the deal.<br><br>

Example:
	<ul><li>Asking a prospect “Do you like what we have Demo’d today or is this feature something that works for your existing workflows?</li>
	<li>Client: “The software seems great and solves a problem we have with Y but installation is too expensive and onboarding is too complicated.</li>
	<li>Salesperson: “If I threw in free installation by one of our experts could we sign the contract today and get you set with a customer success Manager?</li>
	<li>Sneak Peak Closing Technique

<ul><li>In a sneak peak sale close, you review the features of the product and how it will help meet their needs. This approach gives the prospect one more time to really envision what your product might accomplish for them. An example of how this could be done is having a sneak peak video that you share at the time of closing of how this product is used in real time, even better with real case study examples!</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Offering a trial at a reduced rate or a free month’s subscription is a great way to push the deal out, but can bring a lot of value with clients who plan utilizing the tool within the time frame.<br><br>
Example 
	<ul><li>“Should I get into the subscription details so that you can get started quickly? </li>
	<li>“The trial is about to end in the next 72 hours should we start your paid subscription and make it officially official?” </li>
	<li>“Now that I get you, your work flows & how you will find success here would you like to go ahead with a paid subscription so we can get our implantation team on this ASAP?”</li></ul>

                                                        </p>

                        with an org chart so you have a firm grasp on those personas is critical.
                        Thoughtful and targeted outreach will help you get noticed. Use Social selling
                        and multi-level engagement to build awareness to set meetings and close

                        challenges you to learn more about

                        prioritize. Kyle also suggests Setting follow-ups thinking “what does my
                        buyer need from me to make a good decision” rather than “what do I need
                        from my buyer to make a sale”</p>
