                <button class="accordion">What is Saas?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>At its core Software as a Service (SaaS) is a serviced software application that can be accessed
                        by users anywhere, at any time, and on any device. All you need is an internet connection. No
                        user installation or maintenance required. <br><br>

                        Applications like Salesforce, Outreach, Gong, Qualtrics and Highspot and are all SaaS products
                        that are becoming more prevalent in business, but innovative startups are expanding what we
                        think is possible with SaaS through useful, ingenious tech.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Why is Saas more than a subscription plan/service?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        It’s easy to assume SaaS just means software sold as a subscription due to how popular a monthly
                        or annual cost for a SaaS product is, but the reality is the product being sold goes far beyond
                        just a software license. <br><br>
                        The differentiator is in how the software is deployed, managed, supported,
                        and accessed. Since SaaS products are all delivered online, the true value is often seen behind
                        the scenes. The value that emerges is in the physical servers powering access to the software
                        anywhere in the world; compared to the traditional need for server owned and operated by the
                        client. It’s in the developers managing and updating the software on a case-by-case
                        basis to meet client needs in real time; versus a more rigid and static
                        traditional software solution that does not easily allow for differences in
                        releases. It’s in the speed in which software can be deployed to the client; compared to the
                        lengthy set-up process for onboarding new software that requires both acquisition and activation
                        of those physical servers and development team on company time and dollar.

                <button class="accordion">Why Saas Sales is not like software/tech sales.</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Traditional software sales has long been about the product. The focus of
                        demos has been a walkthrough on how to use the product. SaaS differs, as the key point of sale
                        is in that value SaaS brings. Because of this ability to be flexible and agile to client needs,
                        it is vital to show understanding in the challenges the client has and how your SaaS product can
                        solve those challenges.
                        <br><br>
                        This is why building relationships is so important to be a successful SaaS
                        salesperson. You aren’t just selling a product, where after the sale is made
                        you move on to the next prospect. Instead, you are selling the aftercare,
                        support, and ongoing benefits that come with the SaaS model. That means
                        you need trust, understanding, and a strong relationship with any prospect
                        or client to be successful.

                <button class="accordion">Why pursue a career in Saas Sales?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        SaaS Sales is one of the few careers where you can make over $100k in your
                        first year of school, even without a 4-year degree! This is perfect for the
                        money motivated human who wants to meet their financial goals by showing
                        up with grit, working hard to keep metrics high and caring about your buyer
                        and the problems you solve.<br><br>
                        When you first think of sales you may think of the used car salespeople in
                        movies. That narrative could not be farther from the truth in the SaaS sales
                        space. Top Reps are focused on networking & forming value-based
                        relationships with executives called decision makers. The most nurturing,
                        emotionally intelligent, and curious people tend to do the best in these
                        revenue focused roles. Fearlessness and competitiveness are required too.
                        In the SDR role you will use lots of tech tools make the sales cycle easier so being tech savvy
                        is a must. You will use your ability to connect, influence and persuade to set meetings with
                        your buyers. You will get noticed and set these meetings using cold calls, compelling emails,
                        and social media DMS. The best reps get scrappy using video messaging, funny GIFs and attending
                        networking events on behalf of their brand.
                        <br><br>
                        In this SDR role you will be solving real problems companies have, through
                        the value the product you will be selling brings. It takes a hybrid skill set of nurturing
                        relationships, and the hunger to drive a high volume of meetings to keep your pipeline of
                        prospective relationships and buyers full.
                        The average top performer in Sales makes $150k within two years of their
                        Account Executive career. There is a clear trajectory in your sales career
                        unlike many other careers. You can go from SDR to Account Executive to
                        sales leader within 5 years and make hundreds of thousands a year. This
                        sounds like a scam, but it is the reality we see it every day.

                                    What separates good salespeople who meet quota, from those that 
                                    exceed quota and meet their financial goals are those that can manage up to get 
                                    feedback from sr reps including AES and Sales leaders, but also those that can 
                                    analyze what has worked, and what has not worked. In sales there are different 
                                    aspects to success. There are outbound quotas, financial quotas tied to the revenue
                                    brought in and there are quotas specific to SDRs that boil down to qualified 
                                    meetings set. Understanding how your success is measured is the best way to 
                                    create habits that will set you up for long term success within SaaS sales.

                    <p id="center-text">When selling SaaS and Software you will utilize several tools to make your 
                        sales process more seamless. A quick way to get ahead is to study these 
                        tools to put your best foot forward when interviewing and ramping up in your
                        SDR role. Tools like Gong and Outreach, Hubspot and Appollo.io are some of 
                        the best sequencing tools out there. </p>

                    <h4 id="center-text">High Metrics Always Win</h4>
                    <p id="center-text">Sales is like a funnel. You need to do a high volume of outbound to plant 
                        seeds you’ll harvest tomorrow. As those leads get disqualified, less and less 
                        will grow into buyers. Therefore, it is critical that you are outbounding every 
                        day. The dials and emails you send today, are the deals you close 30+ days 
                        out. Keep those metrics high, so that your chances of closing more deals 
                        increases.</p>

                    <p id="center-text">Genuine follow up is the best way to build a relationship with a prospect. 
                        While a little less than half of reps give up after one follow up, and almost 
                        90% give up after the 4th call. keep following up! Be sure to time block (time 
                        block image) your follow ups to be sure you are nurturing relationships with 
                        decision makers. No one likes a transactional sales rep, so focus on 
                        personalization and being human!</p>

                    <p id="center-text">Sales reps by nature are hungry and motivated to set meetings. What 
                        separates good salespeople from great salespeople is their curiosity around 
                        their buyer and the problems their ideal customer has. It is important when 
                        interviewing and carrying out your sales cycle that you show a deep curiosity
                        around case studies, personas, industry trends and the lessons you learn in 
                        your discovery. Keep Studying & Stay Learning!</p>
