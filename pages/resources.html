                        Unfortunately, most people don’t start writing a resume until they need one. The 
                        best time to start building your resume is every time you learn, grow, and win in 
                        your position.
                        In sales you will have a lot of wins and learn a LOT. Keep a resume/career success 
                        journal! 
                        Every week write down your success, and progress. This will help with writing your 
                        resume.
                        Be proactive with selling yourself & get off of using the same Word document you 
                        have been editing repeatedly for years.
                        If you are starting over now: You got this!

                        <big>What to Do</big>
<p>Contact Info:
<ul>
<li>Resume should always match your LinkedIn</li>
<li>Add your Linkedin URL</li>
<li>All contact information should be on your resume</li>
<li>Make sure your phone has voicemail set up, and that you check it</li>
<li>Create a professional email signature for email responses on desktop & 
mobile (no “Get Outlook on iOS”) </li>
<li>Email Signature: Steve Irwin - Your Future SDR + Contact & Linkedin</li></ul>

<p>Formatting is KEY:
    <ul>
<li>Make sure your font is identical and the sizing is consistent</li>
<li>Spacing stays the same and is not awkward</li>
<li>No unnecessary additional pages or spaces - especially blank ones at the end</li>
<li>Date formats should stay the same for every role</li>
<li>Make sure if any positions were contract, or the company did layoffs, that you
illustrate that </li>
<li>Paragraph vs. Bullet Points: 
<ul>
<li>Avoid harder to read paragraph style resumes </li>
<li>Focus on Targeted bullet points based on the job description</li> </ul></li>
<li>Template: Google Docs is a great place to start with templates:
<ul>
<li>Find one where you can list your skill sets at the top such as software 
used, fundraising, cold calling, or any transferable skill sets: </li> 
<li>Sample resume template 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRsRarSiVU8LGQvO9DjdNecLMg
wtGkXLm5LxnnfLC24/edit?usp=sharing</li></ul></li>

<li>Always edit, then edit again - Use Grammarly, get a few sets of eyes on it</li>
<li>Save as a PDF (with your full name and title) helps with formatting transfer 
and makes sure the resume looks the same for anyone who opens it</li></ul>


<p>Value You Bring:
<ul>
<li>Clear examples of how you:
<ul><li>MADE your company money</li>
<li>SAVED them money</li>
<li>IMPROVED something while there</li></ul>
</li><li>Focus: 
<ul><li>Metrics, activity, acomplishments </li>
<li>Use numbers and % as much as possible</li></ul>
</li><li>Clear examples, quantify your activities:
<ul><li>Range, frequency, scale</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Use ACTION $tatements: 
<ul><li>Generated, expanded, accelerated, maximized, analyzed, forecasted, 
persuaded, streamlined, acquired, secured, negotiated, etc</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Headline on resume & Linkedin: 
<ul><li>Manifest the job you want in your headline </li>
<li>“Hungry Sales Development Rep HUNGRY to exceed quota”</li></ul></li>

<li>Use Key Words from the job description and start owning every aspect the 
moment you write it on your resume.  There is a lot to learn on the internet! </li></ul>


<big>What Not to Do</big><br>
<ul><li>Give your full address</li>
<li>Put your photo on your resume</li>
<li>Paragraph Style - you want CLEAR bullet points that are easy to read</li>
<li>Fluff & filler: 10-15 years’ experience is too much paper</li>
<li>There is nothing wrong with a 2-page resume - If the experience is relevant 
list it!</li></ul>

                <div class="tab">
                    <p>Show the employer you have interest in continuing the interview process by trying 
to set another meeting. This approach can also show them that you can close the deal and ask for the sale/Next step in the interview (or sales) cycle. Before you Close, be mindful of the last 6-8 minutes of the call. That is the “Closing Time” So you want to naturally want to approach the close- vs having an awkward or forced end.
<br><br>
When asking questions, and closing an interview show a huge amount of curiosity, by answering questions with another genuine question, naturally introducing the close.

Interview Closing Examples:
<ul><li>“I would really enjoy continuing the conversation about your X role and can 
be available to speak again at xyz time. Is there any way you can help me 
coordinate the next steps in the process or should I reach out to my recruiter 
at IDR?” </li>
<li>“What do next steps from here look like? I am so eager to learn more and add
value to this organization by setting a high volume of meetings and driving 
revenue!” 
</li><li>“What is the overall goal of this call, and can I provide you anymore 
information regarding my track record of success or background to help you 
feel confident in moving me along in this interview process?”
</li><li>“I bet you have talked to a decent number of candidates to fill this and 
similar roles. At this stage in your interviewing what has been missing in the 
candidates? Is there anything about my sales background that I can highlight 
to make sure I am covering any gaps? My goal is to make you feel confident 
enough in me as a seller and culture add so you are willing to invite me to 
next steps so I can win an offer on your team!”
</li><li>“Have I earned your YES to move on to the next interview or are there gaps I 
can sell you on to make you feel proud to move me forward?”
</li><li>“Is there any reason why you would not take me on to next steps? I would 
love your support going forward and continue to add enough value in this 
process to show I am a top performer and someone who can sell into your 
buyer. I want to work here so any advice you have for me would be really 
appreciated! That is if you are comfortable to share any areas for 
improvement or insights from your view. (be careful asking this to 
HR/recruiters as they do not usually like overly direct questions- this question
should be saved for a Sales Leader)

                        Social Selling:
                        <ul>
<li>Follow sales leaders in SaaS. Get obsessed with becoming a 
strong SaaS Seller by following sales leaders on LinkedIn.</li></ul> 
<p>Adding Connections: 
<ul>
<li>Looking up titles like sales development representative and 
filtering by computer software industry is a good place to start 
when finding people who are in this same space. </li>
<li>If you want to follow people who are active on LinkedIn look at 
their activity section or type in #SDR or other hashtags and you 
can filter by all for content and creators. </li></ul>
<p>Some Examples of Sales Leaders we love:

                        <big>LinkedIn Networking 101: Give More Than You Take</big><br><br>

Use the “Value for Value” approach: 
<ul>
<li>Do not ask anyone for favors or 5 minutes of their time. Find 
ways to add value before you ask for a referral or favor. </li>
<li>Do not be transactional and do not sell to people here without an
established familiarity.</li></ul>


<p>Provide insights: 
<ul><li>Set up your LinkedIn to provide insights of who you are and why 
you are badass.</li>
<li>Focus on how you made your company money, saved them 
money, or improved something. 
oAsk for and build your recommendations with past employers, 
clients, and peers. You will never make the sale if you do not ask 
for it. </li>
<li>Make sure your endorsements have key skills required for the 
space you are servicing or trying to get into. 
oHave a catchy about me that gets someone excited about WHO 
you are and why you are good at what you do. Use data 
whenever possible.</li></ul>


<p>Grow your network by 40 people a week: 
<ul><li>Block out 1 hour to do this. Specifically target individuals in the 
space you wish to serve or grow your connections. </li>
<li>Personalize the invites, reading their activity section and engage 
on those posts before and after you send an invite. Who you add 
depends on your goals, but for career moves - peers, internal or 
niche agency recruiters, hiring managers, and leaders.</li></ul>


<p>Engage with your community: 
    <ul>
<li>Block off 30 minutes a day to engage with the community you 
wish to be a part of or add value to. </li>
<li>Provide meaningful comments that show your knowledge, 
passion, curiosity or understanding of the content they write. 
Add likeminded individuals who engage with your comments.</li></ul>


<p>Join groups: 
<ul><li>Women in Sales Club, RevOps Co-op and re:work training and 
excellent micro communities that are so helpful. Network here 
consistently. </li>
<li>At least 1 day a week and find ways to give as much as you take.
They act like family!</li></ul>


<p>Write one piece of content every 48 hours: 
<ul><li>Have a list of key points that come up within the community 
engagement you are a part of. </li>
<li>People who write content consistently almost make it look easy, 
and it can be. The reality of it is, is that you have value to 
provide to these communities if you are fully immersed in the 
space, you are a part of or are trying to serve. </li>
<li>Talk about your wins, your failures, what you are learning, the 
problems you solve in the space you are in, your journey to get 
there. Your hopes and your dreams. Do not overthink it. You are 
enough.</li></ul>


<p>Obsess over the space: 
<ul><li>Read books, listen to podcasts. We love 30 Minutes to 
President's Club. </li>
<li>Develop a deeper understanding, and how to be the best.</li> 
<li>If your goal is to level up in your career it is just as much about 
what you know, as who you know. Click to our 
books/podcasts</li></ul>


<p>Build genuine relationships with the community: 
<ul>
    <li>Following up is the most organic way to build a relationship. Use 
video messaging tools to build rapport. </li>
<li>Recommend on LinkedIn those that have added value to you, 
endorse those that are doing a great job. </li>
<li>Do not be transactional. You belong here, don't worry!</li></ul>

                        <big>Post Content: Building Your Personal Brand</big>
<br><Br>
The age of social media and social selling is in full force. Building your own 
personal brand, especially in a niche and intentional way, will bring big 
results. They say it isn’t about what you know, but who you know and that 
can be 50% true in SaaS!

<ul>
<li>Treat posting content and engaging on LinkedIn like a part time job. 
The more you learn about what it takes to be in these rules, the more 
you should post.</li>
<li>Post one piece of content per week with hashtags. Talk about your 
transferable skill sets in sales, your first sales job, why you think you 
would make a great SDR!</li>
<li>Ask questions like best cold call tips, the best ways to overcome 
objections as a SDR. </li>
<li>The more content you write about sales, your personal experience 
getting into this space and your personality the more awareness sales 
leaders will have to your page. </li></ul>


<p>Content 101
<ul><li>Be real - be genuine, be yourself. You are enough</li>
<li>Post about your failures, your fears, your hopes, your dreams, your 
career story!</li></ul>


<p><big>Personal & Development Post Ideas</big><br><br>

Personal stories: 
<ul>
<li>About your career and what lead you to want to become an SDR/SaaS </li>
sales rep?
<li>About interviews or jobs you have had that have prepared you for a 
career in sales.</li></ul>

<p>Personal Development:
<ul><li>What hard and soft skills have you developed since you got into a 
sales/revenue focused/outbound role? </li></ul>

<p>Growth: 
<ul><li>Post updates on this growth! </li>
<li>What are you learning, what emotions are coming? </li>
<li>What is your plan to master your craft in the future? How are you 
failing at this?</li></ul>

<p>Lessons: 
<ul><li>What 1% improvement did you make to your sales or interview process
this week?</li>
<li>Speaking to the community about the problems we all have, such as
